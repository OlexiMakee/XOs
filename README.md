# XOs

 XOs is the good old Tic-Tac-Toe PvP turn-based game.
 all you need is run XOs.py in your terminal console, program will install a needed library
 
 controls:
     wasd or arrow keys to move selector
     spacebar or enter to select
 
 info:
     Running in terminal, uses readchar library to check input.
     It uses '\033[H\033[J' terminal code to clear screen and '\033[F\033[K' to clear last line, So it should run stably on linux and macos.
     
     NOT TESTED on windows.
     PLESE NOTE! In this code, the Y-axis is always written before the X-axis.
